# Sudoku-Solver

Welcome to the Sudoku Solver project! This project provides a solution for solving 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm implemented in Python. The program allows the user to input a Sudoku puzzle, solve it, and display all possible solutions.

Features:
Input-Friendly: Enter Sudoku puzzles row by row in a user-friendly format.
Handles Empty Cells: Use 0 for empty cells, and the solver will automatically fill them.
Backtracking Algorithm: Uses recursion to find valid solutions by exploring possibilities.
Multiple Solutions: Finds and displays all valid solutions (if more than one exists).
Interactive Solution Viewing: View each solution one by one, with the ability to stop when desired.


Technologies Used:
Python 3
NumPy (for displaying the solution grids)


Example
Here’s a quick example of how to input a puzzle:

After input, the program will solve the puzzle and display the solutions.



Sample Output

If multiple solutions exist, you'll be prompted to view the next solution or exit.
